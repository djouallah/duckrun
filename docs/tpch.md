# TPC-H benchmark

The `tpch-smoke` job in [`cores.yml`](../.github/workflows/cores.yml) generates TPC-H at scale
factor **10** with `tpchgen-cli`, ingests all 8 tables from Parquet into Delta through duckrun's
write path (`conn.read.parquet(...).write.saveAsTable(...)`), then runs the 22 TPC-H queries
through `conn.sql` over `delta_scan` — timing each. It runs on a standard GitHub-hosted runner on
every push, and the scorecard below is rendered live and committed on every push to `main`.

It is a **coverage + cost** check, not a speed contest: the ingestion time is duckrun's write
path, but the 22 query times are DuckDB reading Delta with no second engine to compare against —
so read them as "the whole schema loads and all 22 queries run at SF=10", not a "duckrun is fast"
claim.
